# Guaitil Tourism Management System - Guaitiltour

The system for the Integral Association of Guaitil, born from the main need lacking of visualization on the internet for tourists, since the organization does not have any type of social network or page that provides information, which promote the products they offer and thus attracting tourism in the area because the people of this place live off tourism and in the absence of a page and or social network that promotes them, they have very little tourist demand.

The system is divided into two parts, Back-end (REST API) which is developed with the Spring Boot framework, using JWT as a means of authentication, applying different design patterns to decouple the application, the Front-end (Client) is developed with React JS, using the best practices and resources offered by the library and complementing with Redux for the most efficient management of the application's state.

## Available Scripts

1
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
